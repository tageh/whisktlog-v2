# whiskylog-v2

This is a simple web app that's let's you log the whiskies that you have tried into a database.
It's the same as the other whiskylog I've made, exept this is written with PHP and AJAX.

The functionality as of now is:

  *Instert into a database

  *Retrive the tables for the database

  *Delete a row in the database

TODO:

*Seach functionality

*Sort filter
